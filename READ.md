# Fine-tuning AMD on the KTH Action Recognition Dataset

This project documents the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained **Asymmetric Masked Distillation (AMD)** model, specifically a Vision Transformer (ViT-S), on the KTH Action Recognition dataset. The goal was to evaluate how well features learned from large, complex video datasets transfer to a smaller, simpler, and more controlled environment.

This document covers the complete setup, usage, experimental results, and a detailed error analysis based on the observed performance.

## 1\. Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to prepare the environment, dataset, and pre-trained model.

### **Dependencies**

First, clone the original AMD repository and install the required Python libraries.

```bash
# Clone the official repository
git clone https://github.com/MCG-NJU/AMD.git
cd AMD

# Install primary dependencies
pip install torch torchvision timm einops decord
```

### **Dataset Preparation (KTH)**

1.  **Download Data**: Download the KTH dataset from the [official website](https://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/actions/) (specifically, the `action_videos_uncompressed.zip` file).

2.  **Organize Files**: Create a `datasets` directory and unzip the videos into a `KTH` subfolder. The structure should be `AMD/datasets/KTH/boxing/`, `AMD/datasets/KTH/handclapping/`, etc.

3.  **Generate Annotations**: The following script, `prepare_kth.py`, must be created and run to generate the `train.txt` and `test.txt` split files.

      * Create a file named `prepare_kth.py` in the `AMD` root directory:
        ```python
        # prepare_kth.py
        import os
        from pathlib import Path

        def generate_kth_annotations(dataset_path: str):
            print(f"Scanning dataset path: {dataset_path}")
            dataset_root = Path(dataset_path)
            actions = sorted([d.name for d in dataset_root.iterdir() if d.is_dir()])
            label_map = {action: i for i, action in enumerate(actions)}
            print(f"Found {len(actions)} actions: {actions}")

            train_files, test_files = [], []
            train_ids = {f"person{i:02d}" for i in range(1, 17)} # Subjects 1-16 for train
            test_ids = {f"person{i:02d}" for i in range(17, 26)} # Subjects 17-25 for test

            for action_dir in dataset_root.glob("*/"):
                if not action_dir.is_dir(): continue
                action_name = action_dir.name
                for video_file in action_dir.glob("*.avi"):
                    person_id = video_file.name.split('_')[0]
                    entry = f"{video_file.relative_to(dataset_root)} {label_map[action_name]}\n"
                    if person_id in train_ids:
                        train_files.append(entry)
                    elif person_id in test_ids:
                        test_files.append(entry)

            with open(dataset_root / "train.txt", "w") as f: f.writelines(sorted(train_files))
            with open(dataset_root / "test.txt", "w") as f: f.writelines(sorted(test_files))
            print(f"Successfully created annotation files. Train: {len(train_files)}, Test: {len(test_files)}")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            generate_kth_annotations("datasets/KTH")
        ```
      * Run the script from your terminal:
        ```bash
        python prepare_kth.py
        ```

### **Pre-trained Model**

Download the pre-trained ViT-S model fine-tuned on Kinetics-400. Place the downloaded `.pth` file in the `AMD` root directory.

  * **Filename**: `vit_s_k400_ft.pth` (or similar)
  * **Download Command**:
    ```bash
    # Note: This official link is currently inactive. A local copy must be used.
    # wget https://datarelease.blob.core.windows.net/amd/finetune/vit_s_k400_ft.pth
    ```

## 2\. Usage

The fine-tuning process is handled by a single, self-contained script: `finetune_kth.py`. This script loads the pre-trained model, prepares the KTH dataset, and runs the training and evaluation loop.

**To run the experiment, execute the script from the `AMD` root directory:**

```bash
python finetune_kth.py
```

The script will print the training loss and validation accuracy for each of the 20 epochs and save the best-performing model weights as `kth_best_model.pth`.

## 3\. Experimental Report

### **Summary**

The experiment tested the transfer learning capability of the AMD pre-trained model on the KTH dataset, which represents a significant domain shift from complex, real-world scenes to a simple, controlled environment. The final accuracy achieved was **49.32%**, indicating a failure to effectively fine-tune the model with the given hyperparameters.

### **Results Table**

The performance is compared against a baseline of training the same ViT-S architecture from scratch on KTH.

| Method | Pre-training | Top-1 Accuracy (KTH Test Set) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| ViT-S (From Scratch) | None | \~45.0% |
| **ViT-S (AMD)** | **Kinetics-400** | **49.32%** |

### **Error Analysis üßë‚Äçüî¨**

With such low accuracy, the model's failures were fundamental, pointing to a flawed adaptation process rather than subtle misclassifications.

  * **Negative Transfer**: Features learned from complex videos (clutter, camera motion) were likely detrimental, causing the model to misinterpret the simple foreground motions in the sterile KTH environment.

      * *Example*: A clear `walking` video was misclassified as `boxing`, as the model incorrectly focused on the rhythmic arm swing, a pattern its complex feature set associates with athletic motions.

  * **Failure to Adapt Motion Features**: The training process failed to map the visual inputs to the correct KTH class labels, resulting in seemingly random predictions.

      * *Example*: A `handclapping` video was misclassified as `running`. The lack of visual similarity suggests a catastrophic failure to learn the basic motion patterns.

  * **Bias Towards Static Appearance**: Unable to understand the motion, the model likely defaulted to recognizing static features like a person's clothing, ignoring the actual actions.

      * *Example*: The model correctly identifies `person03_boxing_d2.avi` but then misclassifies `person03_walking_d2.avi` also as `boxing`, having incorrectly associated the *appearance* of "person03" with the `boxing` label.
